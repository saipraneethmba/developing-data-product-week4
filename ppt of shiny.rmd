- Here we have the data to show the ppt of shiny.So what we do is that first we make shiny application and then we link r studio to it.This has been a good assignment and an interesting one too and also this was my first shiny related application.For that what i had done is that i first created a shiny account.
Then wrote the code and ran it.A document opened where i had an option to publish. so i chose shinyio and pasted the secret key in the space mentioned taken from the tokens option in the shiny account and then created it.

## Analysis can be shown in the following code chunk

```r
  formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
    paste("mpg ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")  })
  
  fit <- reactive({
    lm(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), data=mpgData)  })
  ...
  output$fit <- renderPrint({
    summary(fit()) })
  
  output$mpgPlot <- renderPlot({
    with(mpgData, {
      plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()))
      abline(fit(), col=2)
    })  })
```
