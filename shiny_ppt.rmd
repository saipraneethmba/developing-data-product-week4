- URL: *https://github.com/saipraneethmba/developing-data-product-week4*
- You can find here data to present the presentation of the shiny application.Before doing the actual assignment we have to make a shiny application and deploy to r studio servors, next you make a ppt abt the app. 

### The details can be found in the below url

## Analysis is below part

```r
  formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
    paste("mpg ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")  })
  
  fit <- reactive({
    lm(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), data=mpgData)  })
  ...
  output$fit <- renderPrint({
    summary(fit()) })
  
  output$mpgPlot <- renderPlot({
    with(mpgData, {
      plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()))
      abline(fit(), col=2)
    })  })
```
